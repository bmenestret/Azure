## Support Policy
The code and templates in the repo are released under an as-is, best effort, support policy. Palo Alto Networks do not provide technical support or help in using or troubleshooting the components of the project through our normal support options such as Palo Alto Networks support teams, or ASC (Authorized Support Centers) partners and backline support options. The underlying product used (the VM-Series firewall) by the scripts or templates are still supported, but the support is only for the product functionality and not for help in deploying or using the template or script itself.

All projects or work posted in this GitHub repository are provided under the best effort policy.
